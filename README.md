## Why React (Vite) instead of Next.js

* **Familiarity:** As a fresher, Iâ€™m focusing on solidifying React fundamentals before exploring Next.js.
* **Simplicity & Speed:** Viteâ€™s fast dev server and minimal configuration accelerate development and iteration.
* **Project Needs:** This MVP doesnâ€™t require server-side rendering or advanced routingâ€”core React suffices.
* **Future Growth:** I plan to adopt Next.js in future versions to leverage SSR/SSG and builtâ€‘in routing when needed.
